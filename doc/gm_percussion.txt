General MIDI PERCUSSION Key Map
For MIDI Channel 10, each MIDI KEY number ("NOTE#") corresponds to a
different drum sound, as shown below. While many current instruments
also have additional sounds above or below the range show here, and
may even have additional "kits" with variations of these sounds, only
these sounds are supported by General MIDI Level 1 devices.
